# Genome Analysis, VT2020
Genome Analysis, VT2020 project course at Uppsala University. Bioinformatics, MSc. The aims of this course is to utilize available bioinformatic tools and cloud resources to answer a scientific question that will require computationally heavy analyses. This project will be based on a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3972) about the draft genome of the tropical fruit durian (*Durio zibethinus*).

## Introduction
*Durio zibethinus*, other known as Durian, is a fruit indigenous to South East Asia and bears a dense nutrient profile of impressive vitamins and mineral contents, amongst other consitutients. This species, amongst other 30 subsumed species of the genus, is the most commonly appearing and consumed in SEA. It has a very distinct aroma and some might even describe it to be a combination of rotten onions and turpentine garnished with a gym sock. Separately, it is a lipid-rich fruit which describes its creamy texture and ability to taste like ice cream once stored in the freezer for an adequate time. The anatomy of a Durian interestingly resembles the spikey-ness of a hedgehog and the flesh of the fruit resembling a washboard stomach at its prime. Durian is most pungent when it has ripen and its at this point the shell becomes less rigid so it can be easier to be broken and consumed.

In the selected paper, the authors use various softwares to assemble and describe the major players in the draft genome of the aforementioned fruit. They observed upregulation in sulfur (pungent smell) production in durian fruit arils (fruit flesh), expansions in sulfur-related pathway gene families, and that the complexity of the aroma could potentially be linked to the fruit ripening.

[Talk about the fruits potential to tap into the global market.]

As durian becomes a more desirable fruit world-wide and its production is scaled globally, it would be imperative to draw focus on its contribution to biomass. The husk, locules (rind), and seed contributes to about 60% waste after the arils are harvested and consumed. I would like to find out if there is a functional gene that reduces the size of seeds.
